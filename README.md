Overview
- 
I had a lot of fun with this assignment and learned a ton while building it since this is the first application I've built with Python. 
This was a great assignment to understand the fundamentals of Python and interact with Daily Harvest data! This app uses Python 3.8.

Instructions For Running The Program
- 
- To run the app in the browser clone the GitHub repository. 
- In terminal, requests and flask must be installed, write the command: pip install flask requests.
- In terminal, go into the app directory (cd app), and write the command: python3 app.py  
- Go to http://localhost:5000/ or http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the app in the browser.
